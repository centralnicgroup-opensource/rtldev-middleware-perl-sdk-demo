# perl-sdk-demo
Perl SDK Demo App

## Requirements

* Having the most current perl v5 release installed
* Having cpanm installed (App::cpanminus)

Now install our Perl API Connector Library:

```bash
# by Module ID
cpanm WebService::Hexonet::Connector

# or by filename
cpanm HEXONET/WebSservice-Hexonet-Connector-1.03.tar.gz
```
NOTE: I got this only working by sudo'ing these commands.

## Run the App

```bash
perl app.pl
```
